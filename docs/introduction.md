Please do not be alarmed as these challenges are not available until you have solved a pre-requisite challenge.

If you get stuck on a challenge, don't spend too much time on it and move onto another challenge to come back to it later.

### Live Challenges

In this CTF environment, there are ***live challenges*** that require you to open a ticket in the respective Discord server and post your responses from there.

***Note: The ticketing system isn't meant to be used to ask for help or hints. Please use the respective #help channel in the Discord server to ask for help. CTF Staff will not hold your hands in solving any challenges***

More information about [Challenges](challenges.md).

### Flags

All challenges have a standard flag format that is to be accepted as the answer to the challenge.

**Flag Example:**

    ISC2{This is a Flag}
    ISC2{caSE inSenSiTive FlAg}

In order to make this CTF easier, all flags are case insensitive and doesn't require you to have exactly the correct capital and lower case letters in the flag. However, there are submission limitations to prevent flooding random guesses. 

All multiple choice challenges will only allow **1 (ONE)** submission before the challenge is removed. All other challenges will only allow **3 (three)** submissions before the challenge is removed. 

***Note: Once the challenge is removed, you will not be given the chance to solve it again at a later time. So please put in some time and thought before submitting a flag.***

### Hints

We have provided hints onto all of our challenges. The first teaser hint cost **0** points, however each additional hint beyond the first one will cost you points.

***Note: You may only ask for help in the Discord channel (#help) and nowhere else. CTF Staff will ignore direct messages or tickets asking for help. This is a competition, not a class.***

| Difficulty | Points |
