# Web Exploitation

**"Online Rule-Breaking":** Web exploitation is like when some people try to break the rules on the internet. Just as there are rules in games and in school, there are rules for using the internet. Web exploitation is when people don't follow those rules.

**"Not Being Nice":** Explain that web exploitation can mean not being nice to others online. For example, some people might say mean things, spread false information, or even try to steal information from others. It's important to be kind and respectful online, just like they are in person.

**"Cyberbullying and Hacking":** Mention that web exploitation can include things like cyberbullying, which is when someone is mean to others online, and hacking, which is when someone tries to break into other people's online accounts or systems. These are not good things to do.

**"Online Safety and Responsibility":** Emphasize the importance of online safety and being responsible on the internet. Just as they should look both ways before crossing the street, they should also be cautious and responsible when using the internet.

**"Tell an Adult":** Encourage them to talk to a trusted adult, like a parent, teacher, or school counselor, if they ever come across something online that makes them uncomfortable or if someone is unkind to them.
